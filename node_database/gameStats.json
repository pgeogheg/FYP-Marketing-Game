      "contents": "A third of clothes bought online last month in the UK were returned after customers tried them on at home, it has been revealed. The survey, published by UK Retail Watch, showed 62 per cent of people returning clothes blamed how they fitted once they’d tried them out, while 18 per cent said products appeared different in real life to their pictures on the website. It shows that despite the growing popularity of online clothes shopping, customers are ‘more than willing to return items they aren’t completely satisfied with’, according to UK Retail Watch analyst Ralph Bowman. \nHe added: ‘If 33 per cent of customers are saying they aren’t happy with their clothes and are sending them back, the online clothes shopping model clearly isn’t a magic cure for slumps in high-street growth. ‘Profit margins for online-only clothing companies can be rather slim, so returns can make a big difference. ‘It’s interesting that clothing companies that augment their bricks-and-mortar retailing with online shopping saw fewer returns of clothes last month. It’s likely that some customers first see and try on items on the high street, then purchase later online.’ The companies behind the BeUnique, Modismo and FashionFirst retail websites all have recorded dips in growth for the second consecutive quarter.\n Source: The Sunday Chronicle (Sunday broadsheet newspaper)"

      "contents": "Q – What’s the next big trend in jeans? \nA – I think young people and students are crying out for the big jeans brands to let them customise their pairs online. We already see it with sportswear companies, especially with trainers, and jeans will soon follow suit. Lots of shoppers already do it themselves. \n\nQ – What evidence is there that customising jeans is so popular?\nA – Just look around you when you go out! Younger shoppers don’t just want traditional plain jeans, they tend to go for trendier pairs, such as the boom in wearing skinny jeans, or they’re customising their own. I see loads of people dyeing their jeans, bleaching them, using patches, studs, beads, there’s lots you can do. It’s all about feeling ‘unique’, and expressing their personalities through fashion, I think. \n\nQ – Where can we buy our own? \nA – There are websites that let you do it, or that give you tips on how to customise at home – I’ve heard of a few bloggers putting tutorials up on YouTube – but if you ask me most kids want the end-result of customised jeans, but also the convenience of doing it online and a finished product guaranteed to not have any flaws. I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the big brands started catching on soon. \n\nSource: Catwalk (high-end monthly fashion magazine)"
